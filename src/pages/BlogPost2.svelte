            <p class="pb-3">
                My first post was about why I chose Software Development. Why I
                didn't continue with Civil Engineering. I thought my second post
                should cover why I chose to take a coding boot camp.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-3">
                I left engineering in 2016 and didn't enroll in a coding boot
                camp until 2020. There is time gap because I was still trying to
                understand what the future would look like. I have not mentioned
                what triggered this change, but it is the biggest part of my
                life after 2016. Deciding to change career paths after already
                having so much invested time, energy, money is terrifying. It
                isn't an easy or friendly endeavor. It is messy, cold, scary and
                sometimes hopeless.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-3">
                I was in that place emotionally because life took a big swing at
                me when I wasn't looking and I was completely unprepared. I
                didn't take time to put myself back together. I was trying to
                continue on with broken bones and bruises but I needed to stop
                and let myself recover. At the time, my intentions were to
                continue with engineering. I was going to use that time away to
                study for my exam and be all ready to get my professional
                license. I enjoy learning and was going to also use that time to
                learn Python because it would be useful to know for GIS software
                I used.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-3">
                Life is unpredictable and things change constantly. While
                recovering I started thinking about my future as an engineer and
                what I wanted to do. What was my purpose with engineering? What
                would I need to do to feel like I was doing what I planned to
                do? How do I get to that place? I started thinking about the
                time and effort I would have to put in to do what I wanted. I
                wanted to work for the EPA at some point and be a part of policy
                making. That was going to take a lot more time, effort and work
                than I had previously anticipated. As much as I wanted to
                continue with that path, I took a second to consider if I would
                be able to accomplish what I wanted to in a role like that. I
                considered other career paths I have always wanted, or things I
                wanted to do. I spent time trying to understand what I was
                passionate about because I didn't want to work myself into this
                same place again.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-3">
                I have always been a person who has to have a purpose that is
                worth the effort. I struggle to put all my energy into something
                I don't care about.
