            I had a short career in Civil Engineering before I decided to take a
            step back to reevaluate my life goals. I took some time to volunteer
            with nonprofits, substitute for my public school district, become a
            support group leader and start a small art business. Through each
            option, there was a connecting factor. The importance of software
            development. I saw gaps that could be filled with the right software
            application. I got tired of saying, "if only someone would build..."
            Why wait for someone else to build it? I could do that, I just
            needed to learn how. So I started learning on my own but soon
            realized that I needed some guidance. With so much out there, I
            didn't know what I should concentrate on. I enrolled and completed
            the UT Austin Full Stack Web Development program and am ready to
            start my journey as a junior web developer. Other things about me. I
            enjoy to draw and have a small art business. More indepth

            volunteer. I foster kittens when they are too young to adopt out and
            care for them until they find a forever home. I work with multiple
            cat rescues and provide help with transportation for cats between
            East Texas and North Texas. I hope to build a web application that
            will aid cat rescue logistics. I am an artist Doodlejutsu:
