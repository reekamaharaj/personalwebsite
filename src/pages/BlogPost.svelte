                    After getting a bachelor's in Civil Engineering and working in the field, why change careers to software development?
                </p>

                <p class="pb-3">
                    Seems like a small question; but it really is a huge question. The decision came from multiple angles. First, the concern for my career path. I love Civil Engineering and enjoyed the work, but looking at my future I wasn't sure if it fit the life I wanted. If you don't know about Civil Engineering, that's understandable. Here's what the Civil Engineering Wikipedia page has.

                    <b>Civil engineering</b> is a professional <b>engineering</b> discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.

                    If you sit and think about what is contained in that definition, you'll notice that it covers pretty much every single thing you run into every day. Civil engineering is one of the oldest professions and as society grows, the scope of Civil engineering grows with it. I loved it because of how broad it is, how many subjects it stretches to cover. I love it because it is community service at its core. When people ask me what Civil engineers do, I usually answer with, "Well, if a civil engineer does their job perfectly, you won't know it. But if they don't do the best job, or their work degrades, you will notice right away."

                <p class="py-6">
                    Basic examples: Utilities in your house. If your water pressure drops, there's a civil engineer somewhere helping to fix that. If you run into road construction, there's a civil engineer somewhere working on that.
                </p>
                <p class="py-6">
                    So why did I pick it? Because that's exactly what I want my life to be. I want to help everyone I can, and I want to do it as quietly as possible. I want to be the nice ninja that fixes and supports everyone without them having to think about it. So if it fit me so perfectly, why would I leave?
                </p>
                <p class="py-6">
                    Engineering is a profession thatâ€™s integral to everyday life, and as a result it is VERY demanding. City council meetings, working with local government, working with commercial entities, working with the public, working with other professionals. There are many hats that one engineer has to wear. There are extra hours outside of full time office hours that are needed. It's grueling. It's thankless.
                </p>
                <p class="py-6">
                    As much as I love it. It took more from me than I got back. I love learning, I love understanding more than what I'm working on. Working full time I didn't have time to devote to learning about other topics. I didn't have the time or energy to learn on my own. The software I wanted to learn more about was expensive and I only had access to it on my work computer. The training classes were expensive and during work hours, often needed to be initiated by my employer. While my employers wanted to have me complete the training, they still needed me to be in the office.

                <p class="py-6">
                    I had spent two years in the field and was starting to study for the Professional Engineering exam that I could take to get my license. It's a hard exam, and takes a lot of extra effort to prepare for. I realized this was the perfect time for me to really consider if this was going to be something I wanted to continue. If I did consider leaving, what would take its place?
                </p>
                <p class="py-6">
                    I love analyzing, understanding and solving problems. Most importantly, I love learning. I needed to find a career path that would require those skills but also provide me with vast resources so that I could learn on my own time. Something that would allow me to pursue further learning on my own. Software development was an obvious path for me. I have been around coding my whole life, my dad is a coder and I was surrounded by C++ and Oracle books for as long as I remember.
                </p>
                <p class="py-6">
                    I'll be honest. I avoided coding as long as I could. Purely because of stubbornness. I don't like doing something unless I know it was my idea. I had to come to it on my own, or I was going to hate it. After leaving engineering I started working with nonprofits. My main focus was working with cat rescues and mental health advocacy nonprofits. While working with these organizations, I started to notice a gap in technology. I noticed that things could be so much easier if someone came along and built the right tool for them. But since they are nonprofits, there isn't financial support to create those applications. There isn't incentive for developers to create them since the organizations that would use them don't have funds to pay for them.
                </p>
                <p class="py-6">
                    I decided that I wanted to try and create things that could help. But I needed to learn more about software development before I could even think about that. I tried self learning, and while that started well it didn't last for long. I didn't have the consistency I needed to keep the momentum going. I always ended up getting overwhelmed by the amount of information. I decided to sign up for a coding boot camp finally. I had considered it before, but never felt comfortable picking a program. But I got an email from the University of Texas at Austin about their Full Stack coding boot camp and signed up within a week. I have gotten my Bachelor's in Civil engineering from UT Austin and trust them completely to have a good program.
                </p>
                <p class="py-6">
                    I am so glad I signed up for it. I got the consistent push to keep learning. I didn't have the option to stop moving forward. I had people to talk to who were learning the same things and I had specific things to focus on building. I have the foundation I have been wanting and now I can learn on my own. I have a better understanding of what needs to be considered when creating a new project. I have the tools I need to make things work. And most importantly, I know what to Google to help me make progress with whatever I am working on!
                </p>
                <p class="py-6">
                    So here I am. A junior software developer starting out in a new career path. I am excited to build everything I've wanted to build for years. I can keep learning and it isn't dependent on my employer. I don't even have to spend money on courses if I don't want to. As long as I have a computer and access to the internet, I can learn anything and start applying that new knowledge right away.
                </p>
                <p class="py-6">
                    So. That's why software development :D.
