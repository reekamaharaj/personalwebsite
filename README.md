## Planning Consideration
### Audience - What a visiter would want from the site
    - Questions to answer: Why are they on the site?
    - Potential employers
    - Other new coders
    - Anyone interested in seeing what I'm working on currently

### Message - What I want the site to say
    - Question to answer: What do I want them to leave the site with?
    [x] Reason for career shift
    - Clear story of my after bootcamp journey
    - Never give up - other newbie coders
    - Share the coding zen
    - Who I am completely, authentically, upfront

### Call to Action
    What is the most important take away from the site. Minimum. Someone should know my current skills, competency, experience, who I am as a coder/person.

### Frameworks/Stack/DB/Tech to Use & Motivation for use
    - Svelte: To learn through building an app
    - JS, TS: Currently comfortable with these.
    - Snowpack: To learn and understand more. Get a better understanding of what a bundler does. Comparing experiences with different methods will help me understand the bigger picture of what a bundler can do. How they work, what is typical, what is specifically for one bundler over another.
    - Firebase: Potential for growth with the other features avaliable. With a built site, it would be easy to see how other features work, why they would be used, and also to the potential new additions Google will inevitably have.
        - Firebase hosting: Loads faster than Heroku. Easy setup. Domain is with GoogleDomains
        - FireStore: To learn through building an app.

### SEO Strategy - Should be considered
    - Consider website traffic
    - Keywords
